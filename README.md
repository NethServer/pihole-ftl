# pihole-ftl

The packages provides:
- Pi-hole FTL binary
- systemd unit

RPM built from binaries available at [Pi-hole FTL repository](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/releases).

We ships pre-built binaries because rebuild for EL7 requires a newer version of nettle library.
More info inside the [official documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/compile/).
